# Melvin-Mind
This is the repository for my Project Melvin the Mind. As of 3rd of August 2017 12:20 AM I hereby officially start this project. The aim of this project is to create an open source program/AI whose purpose is to create how to instructions for completing tasks based on data analyzed from its library. All help is greatly welcomed including, but not limited to: contributing graphics, audio, and text directories; AI coding; supervising AI learning; teaching other contributors. All who help will be given credit. I would also like to help people get white papers as well.
